# Number Guessing Game (JAVA):
A simple Java console-based Number Guessing Game where the user gets 5 chances to guess a random number between 1 and 99. It handles invalid inputs using try-catch and uses recursion for repeated input. Key Java concepts used include static methods, loops, conditionals, and Math.random().
The program also keeps track of attempts and displays the correct number if the user fails. It demonstrates basic exception handling, user input validation, and control flow in Java.
